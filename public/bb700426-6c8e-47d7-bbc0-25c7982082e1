Request for Comments: 12  REVISED                         26 August 1969
                    IMP-HOST INTERFACE FLOW DIAGRAMS
   The following flow diagrams were extracted from the logic diagrams
   provided in Appendix B of BBN Report No. 1822.  These diagrams
   indicate the logical sequence of hardware operations which occur
   within the IMP-HOST interface.  The logic names appearing in the
   blocks correspond to the logic elements found in Appendix B.
